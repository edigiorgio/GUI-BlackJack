# GUI-BlackJack
A full black jack game created using Windows forms and C# with multiple classes and full functionality
Program can be run with only the EXE file and cards files, when running the program the cards must be installed in a folder named cards inside
the same directory as the exe. The easiest way to do this is just create a folder named blackjack and a folder inside of that named cards and
install into the respective folders. I hope you enjoy
